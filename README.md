## MyEventTracker

My event tracker is a simple app I created to keep track of the past, present, and future or my social calender so that I'm able to keep all the details straight. It makes it easy to look back fondly on memories of past adventures with friends and family while keeping accurate records of the who, what, where, when, and how. You can Create a user profile, then start making a custom location, category, then an event. Each event has a location and a category assigned to it. Users keep all of their event, location, and category information private and unique to their individual accounts.
